# Different ways to contact us:

## IRC & Matrix

The official IRC channel is `#ZeroPhone` on `freenode`, and official Matrix
room is `#zerophone:matrix.org` (connected together). It's used both for casual
talk and for discussions about ZeroPhone and ZPUI development, debugging and
issues.

- [logs](https://mozzwald.com/irclog/zerophone/)

If you don't get a response in time (because of timezones and other reasons
people might not be online) and have to leave - **please, leave your email
address** (or other form of communication) before leaving IRC, so that we can
get back to you (you can PM your contact details i.e. email to **CRImier** on
IRC/Matrix as well, or send an email - link below).

Do keep in mind that, as of now, DMs on Freenode are not working for users that
haven't registered their nickname.
