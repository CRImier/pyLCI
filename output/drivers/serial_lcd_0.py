 NOT WORKING
 The first output driver I did. The idea was having an Arduino which would have a 16x2 screen connected,
 take a string over serial, clear the screen, put first 16 characters on the first line, second 16 characters on the second line
 and discard the rest.
 Hey, it worked. I'm leaving this here in case you need an example or something.
 Can't enable backlight, can't just clear the screen, is config-compatible and theoretically is even working. No Arduino code included.
