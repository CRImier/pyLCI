Fixedsys 62by soixantedeux26 March 2007	This font is free. It may not be resold for profit; however, it may beredistributed and sold at cost of redistribution. Distribute this font freely,on the condition that this notice remain with it unmodified. The font, however,may be modified on the condition that it is distributed under the sameconditions as above.	This is a hand-made TrueType version of the classic Windows system font"Fixedsys", based on six different .FON files from C:\Windows\Fonts. Incontrast to Fixedsys, Fixedsys 62 is not only done in TrueType as opposed tobitmap, but is also contained in a single font file that includes standardLatin, Greek and Cyrillic letters. Modifications have also been made to fixerrors made when the font was originally made, although some of its quirkinessshould still be present. And as always, teeny-tiny modifications have been madeto ensure that Fixedsys 62 won't break in Flash (while the original Fixedsys ispretty good about not breaking in Flash, there are a few characters that Flashwill screw up).	In this ZIP archive you should find this readme and two files:Fixedsys62.ttf and Fixedsys62Mac.ttf. The only difference between these twofiles is that Fixedsys62.ttf will make the font show up as "Fixedsys 62" in thefont menu, whereas Fixedsys62Mac.ttf should make the font show up as just"Fixedsys", so that when people set that as a font on an HTML page, the fontwill show up correctly. I'd advise Windows users against installingFixedsys62Mac.ttf, because it might conflict with the original Fixedsys font.		If you like this font, feel free to let me know! My website, whichcontains other things I've done, is located at http://www.soixantedeux.us/, orif that doesn't work, http://www.freewebtown.com/62/. If you have any questionsor comments regarding this font, contact me. Also, if you use this fontsomewhere and you're particularly proud of the way you used it, don't hesitateto let me know. :) I'm interested in what will happen to this font after I putit up for download.	Thanks for downloading Fixedsys 62!										  soixantedeux
