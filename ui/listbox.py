    Attributes:

    * ``contents``: list of listbox entries

      Listbox entry is a list, where:
         * ``entry[0]`` (entry's label) is usually a string which will be displayed in the UI, such as "Option 1". If ``entry_height`` > 1, can be a list of strings, each of those strings will be shown on a separate display row.
         * ``entry[1]`` (entry's value) is the value to be returned when entry is selected. If it's not supplied, entry's label is returned instead.

      You can also pass ``Entry`` objects as entries - ``text`` will be used as label and ``name`` will be used as name.

      *If you want to set contents after the initalisation, please, use set_contents() method.*
    * ``pointer``: currently selected entry's number in ``self.contents``.
    * ``in_foreground`` : a flag which indicates if listbox is currently displayed. If it's not set, inhibits any of listboxes actions which can interfere with other UI element being displayed.
