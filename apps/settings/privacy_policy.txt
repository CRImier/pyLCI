This application allows you to send us the ZPUI log files to help us solve ZPUI
and ZeroPhone problems. It will never do so without your explicit confirmation.
In the future, when we implement opt-in automatic notifications on exceptions,
then it will prompt you for confirmation using a notification or a context switch.

This function is meant to be used together with ZPUI/ZeroPhone online issue trackers,
such as one located at https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/issues . Logs that will be sent
without a request from our side will be, nevertheless, examined, under the assumption
that the user sent them to help us fix a ZPUI/ZeroPhone problem.

Note that there might still be personally identifying information in the logs (for
example, input exception catching mechanism also prints out local variables from
where the problem occured). In the future, we'll add a mechanism for you to review
the files before they're sent to us, access them and edit them.

We will only store your files for as long as it takes to identify the problem, but
no more than 30 days. The bugreport contents, if successfully processed by our backend,
will be emailed to our Protonmail account, then, when received,will be downloaded to
our portable device of choice (most likely, a personal laptop), examined, filtered through
and then deleted once the problem is resolved (or 30 days pass). Currently, only the main
developer (Arsenijs) has access to the email account, you'll be notified if the situation
changes. If this bugreport processing mechanism doesn't suit you, we're thinking of a way
for you to run your own personal server for notifications as one of the possible workarounds.

All code used in our notification backend is open-source and can be seen at
https://github.com/ZeroPhone/vsftpd_log_box . The code used in this app can be seen
at https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/blob/{YOUR_CURRENT_BRANCH}/apps/settings/bugreport_ui.py .
