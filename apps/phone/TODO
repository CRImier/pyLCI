First iteration:

Phone, SMS and some misc functions
The simplest interface, connects directly to serial from the app and parses things
Can handle unexpected AT messages to some extent, supports RING and SMS callbacks
Only tested on SIM800L

Second iteration:

Separate daemon for comms with modem (installed se)
pyLCI app connects to daemon, sets callbacks on events and can also use AT commands

Daemon:
	State machine
	Accepts RPC calls and AT commands through a separate socket
pyLCI app:
	Connects to the daemon
	Talks to the modem abstraction, receives callbacks

Benefits of second iteration:
	Fault-proofing monitoring
	Flexibility
	Stability
	No race conditions
	Better layer separation
	Less threads in one Python app = more responsive
