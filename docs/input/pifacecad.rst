PiFaceCAD input driver
######################

This driver works with `PiFace Control and Display <www.piface.org.uk/products/piface_control_and_display/>`_ Raspberry Pi shields. 

Sample config.json section:

.. code:: json

    "input":
       [{
         "driver":"pfcad"
       }]


.. note:: Generally, you won't need to edit ``config.json`` if you're using this shield because it'll be done automatically by ``config.sh``.

.. toctree::

.. automodule:: input.drivers.pfcad
 
.. autoclass:: InputDevice
