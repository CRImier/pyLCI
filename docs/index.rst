Welcome to ZPUI documentation!
=================================

ZPUI stands for ZeroPhone UI, it's the official user interface for ZeroPhone (installed on ZeroPhone official SD card images). It allows you to interact with your ZeroPhone, using the 1.3" OLED and the 30-button numpad.

ZPUI is based on pyLCI, a general-purpose UI for embedded devices. However, unlike pyLCI, 
ZPUI is tailored for the ZeroPhone hardware, namely, the 1.3" monochrome OLED 
and 30-key numpad (though it still retains input&output drivers from pyLCI), and 
it also ships with ZeroPhone-specific applications.
