Welcome to ZPUI documentation!
=================================

ZPUI (ZeroPhone UI, pronounced *zippy ui*) is a powerful user interface and app framework for small screens. It was designed for the ZeroPhone project,
but it's usable on a wide variety of single-board computers.

Minimum requirements:
    - monochrome 128x64 or larger screen (OLED/LCD)
    - 5 buttons

ZPUI is based on pyLCI, a general-purpose UI for embedded devices, an interface that supports 16x2 and larger character displays.
Currently. ZPUI is tailored for the ZeroPhone hardware, namely, the 1.3" monochrome 128x64 OLED 
and 30-key numpad (though it still retains input&output drivers from pyLCI), and it also ships with ZeroPhone-specific applications.

At the moment, ZPUI is being made more generic and tested across many different single-board computers, and the documentation is being improved
along with the effort.
