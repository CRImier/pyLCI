==================
Applications
==================

Applications are layer between user's goals and same goals accomplished. pyLCI applications are similar to desktop applications, each of them is mean to perform one function/set of similar functions, and perform it well.
There can be an application for any task you want to use pyLCI for - in the worst case, you can write one ;-)

Applications bundled with the default install are:

   * :ref:`apps_clock`
   * :ref:`apps_i2ctools`
   * :ref:`apps_lsusb`
   * :ref:`apps_mocp`
   * :ref:`apps_network`
   * :ref:`apps_partitions`
   * :ref:`apps_scripts`
   * :ref:`apps_shutdown`
   * :ref:`apps_system_info`
   * :ref:`apps_systemctl`
   * :ref:`apps_tvservice`
   * :ref:`apps_update`
   * :ref:`apps_volume`
   * :ref:`apps_wpa_cli`
