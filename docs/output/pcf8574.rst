PCF8574 I2C LCD backpack driver
###############################

This driver works with PCF8574 IO expanders. You can see an guide on modifying them and connecting them to LCD screens & I2C `here. <http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Using-1-I2C-LCD-Backpacks-for-1602-Sc/>`__

       [{
         "driver":"pcf8574",
         "kwargs":
          {
           "addr":"0x3f"
          }
       }]


.. note:: If you provide backpack's I2C address as a kwarg, you should pass it as a string (as shown above).

To test your screen, you can just run ``python output/driver/pcf8574.py`` while your screen is connected to I2C bus (you might want to adjust parameters in driver's ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` section). It will initialize the screen and show some text on it.
