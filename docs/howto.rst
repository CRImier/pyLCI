Basics
======

.. _howto_minimal_zpui_app:

What's the minimal ZPUI app?
----------------------------

In ``app/main.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    menu_name = "Skeleton app"

    # These two variables will be automatically assigned by init_app
    # unless you define your own init_app. However, you do need to define them
    # - for now, just for readability.
    i = None #Input device
    o = None #Output device
    
    def callback():
        #Gets called when app is selected from menu
        pass

``app/__init__.py`` has to be an empty file:

.. code-block:: python

.. _howto_zpui_helloworld:

"Hello, world!"
---------------

In ``app/main.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    menu_name = "Hello, world!"

    # An UI element that does most of the legwork for us
    from ui import PrettyPrinter as Printer

    i = None #Input device
    o = None #Output device
    
    def callback():
        # will show text on screen for 3 seconds and then exit
        Printer("Hello, world!", i, o, 3)

------------

.. _howto_minimal_zpui_class_app:

What's the minimal class-based app?
-----------------------------------

In ``app/main.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from apps import ZeroApp

    class YourGreatApp(ZeroApp):
        menu_name = "Skeleton app"

        def on_start():
            #Gets called when app is selected from menu
            pass

``app/__init__.py`` has to be an empty file, as with the previous example.
     
------------

.. _howto_zpui_app_sandbox:

Experiment with ZPUI code
=========================

You can use the sandbox app to try out ZPUI code. First, stop the system-wide ZPUI
process if it's running (use ``sudo systemctl stop zpui``). Then, run this in the
install folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo python main.py -a apps/example_apps/sandbox

.. code-block:: python

    [...]
    Python 2.7.13 (default, Nov 24 2017, 17:33:09)
    [GCC 6.3.0 20170516] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>>

Available variables:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dir()
    ['__builtins__', '__code__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__',
    'callback', 'context', 'i', 'init_app', 'menu_name', 'o', 'set_context']

In short, you get ``i``, ``o``, a ``context`` object, and you can import all the
usual things you'd import in your app - like UI elements

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from ui import Canvas
    >>> c = Canvas(o, interactive=True)
    >>> c.centered_text("Hello world!")

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_7.png

------------

User-friendliness
=================

Whether your app involves a complex task, a task that could be done in multiple
different ways or just something plain and simple, there are UI elements, functions
and snippets that can help you make your app more accessible to the user.

.. _howto_confirm_a_choice:

Confirm a choice
----------------

In case you're unsure the user will want to proceed with what you're doing,
you might want them to confirm their actions. Here's how to ask them that:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import DialogBox

    message = "Are you sure?"
    choice = DialogBox ('ync', i, o, message=message, name="HDD secure erase app erase confirmation").activate()
    if choice:
        erase_hdd(device_path)

By default, Yes returns ``True``, No returns ``False`` and Cancel returns ``None``.

.. _howto_one_out_of_many:

Pick one thing out of many
--------------------------

If you have multiple things and you need your user to pick one, here's how to
let them choose:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import Listbox, PrettyPrinter
    ...
    # You pass lists of two elements - first one is the user-friendly label,
    # second is something that your code can actually use
    # (doesn't have to be a string)
    lc = [["Kingston D4", "/dev/bus/usb/001/002"], ["Sandisk Ultra M3", "/dev/bus/usb/001/002"]]
    # The user will want to know what is it you want them to choose;
    # Showing a quick text message is a good way to do it
    PrettyPrinter("More than one drive found, pick a flash drive", i, o, 5)
    path = Listbox(lc, i, o, name="USB controller flashing app drive selection menu").activate()
    if path: # if the user pressed left key to cancel the choice, None is returned
        print(path)

.. note:: If you autogenerate the listbox contents from an external source (for
          example, your user needs to pick one flash drive from a list of all
          connected flash drives), it's best if you check that the user really
          has any choice in the matter - as in, maybe there's only one flash drive
          connected?

-----------

.. _howto_many_out_of_many:

Enable/disable options
----------------------

If you want user to be able to enable or disable settings or let them filter
through a really long list of options to choose from, here's what you can do:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import Checkbox
    ...
    # You pass lists of two/three elements - first one is the user-friendly label
    # second is something that you'll receive as a response dictionary key,
    # and you can optionally add the third element telling the default state
    # (True/False)
    # (doesn't have to be a string)
    cc = [["Replace files that were changed", "replace_on_change", config["replace_on_change"]],
          ["Delete files from destination", "delete_in_destination", config["delete_in_destination"]],
          ["Save these settings", "save_settings"]]
    choices = Checkbox(cc, i, o, name="Backup app options dialog").activate()
    if choices: # if the user pressed left key to cancel the choice, None is returned
        print(choices)
    # {"replace_on_change":True, "delete_in_destination":False, "save_settings":False}

-----------

.. _howto_show_progress:

Indicate progress
-----------------

If you're going to launch a background task, it's best if the user knows what's
happening. The simplest way is to print something on the screen:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import PrettyPrinter
    ...
    PrettyPrinter("Scanning ports", i, o, 5)
    results = scan_ports()
    print_results(results)

Or, a little bit prettier:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import Canvas
    ...
    c = Canvas(o)
    c.centered_text("Scanning ports")
    c.display()
    results = scan_ports()
    print_results(results)

Or, even better - use a LoadingIndicator UI element, which is much prettier and
user-friendly:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import LoadingIndicator
    ...
    with LoadingIndicator(i, o, message="Scanning ports"):
        results = scan_ports()
    print_results(results)

.. _howto_show_progress_with_percentage:

What if you actually know how much of the task is completed? Then, you can use a
ProgressBar, which is going to show the user a percentage of the task completed:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import ProgressBar
    ...
    ports = [22, 23, 80, 111, 443]
    with ProgressBar(i, o, message="Scanning ports") as pb:
        process = PortScanner(ports)
        process.start()
        while process.is_ongoing():
            current_port_index = ports.index(process.current_port)
            # Calculating progress from 0 to 100
            progress = int( 100.0/len(ports) * current_port_index )
            pb.progress = progress
    print_results(results)

-----------

.. _howto_pick_a_file_dir:

Pick a file/directory
---------------------

In case your user needs to work with files, here's how you can make the file picking
process easy for them:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import PathPicker
    ...
    # You might already have some kind of path handy - maybe the one that your user
    # picked last time?
    path = os.path.split(last_path)[0] if last_path else '/'
    new_path = PathPicker(path, self.i, self.o, name="Shred app file picker").activate()
    if new_path: # As usual, the user can cancel the selection
        self.last_path = new_path # Saving it for usability

The ``PathPicker`` also supports a ``callback`` attribute which, instead of
letting the user pick one file and returning it, lets the user just click on
files and calls a function on each one of them as they're selected. An example
of this working is the "File browser" app in "Utils" category of the main menu.

.. _howto_exit_loop_on_keypress:

Allow exiting a loop on a keypress
-----------------------------------

Say, you have a loop that doesn't have an UI element in it - you're just doing something
repeatedly. You'll want to let the user exit that loop, and the reasonable way is to
interrupt the loop when the user presses a key (by default, ``KEY_LEFT``).
Here's how to allow that:

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import ExitHelper
    ...
    eh = ExitHelper(i).start()
    while eh.do_run():
        ... #do something repeatedly until the user presses KEY_LEFT

Stopping a foreground task on a keypress
----------------------------------------

If you have some kind of task that's running in foreground (say, a HTTP server), you will
want to let the user exit the UI, at least - maybe even stop the task. If a task can be
stopped from another thread, you can use ``ExitHelper``, too - it can call a custom function
that would signal the task to stop.

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import ExitHelper
    ...
    task = ... # Can be run in foreground with ``task.run()``
    # Can also be stopped from another thread with ``task.stop()``
    eh = ExitHelper(i, cb=task.stop).start()
    task.run() # Will run until the task is not stopped

Auto-regenerating menu contents
-------------------------------

Say, you have a menu with an entry that toggles an LED on and off. You want to make it
user-friendly, so you want to display the status of the LED in that same menu, and
update the menu entry label to reflect the LED status. In other words, let's say your
LED is off by default, so your menu has an "LED off" entry, and when the user presses it,
it turns the LED on and changes the entry text to "LED on". Here's how you can do that:

.. code-block:: python

    led_status = False

    def enable_led():
        global led_status
        ... # Toggle the GPIO or something
        led_status = True

    def disable_led():
        global led_status
        ... # Toggle the GPIO or something
        led_status = False

    def callback():
        def gen_menu_contents():
            led_entry = ["LED on", disable_led] if led_status else ["LED off", enable_led]
            return [led_entry]
        Menu([], i, o, "LED app menu", contents_hook=gen_menu_contents).activate()

``gen_menu_contents`` will be called each time ``Menu`` goes to foreground (``activate``,
after finishing executing a callback etc.) and should return
the new ``contents`` for the ``Menu``, which the ``Menu`` will then set as its new
``contents``. Obviously, it's best if it doesn't run too long, otherwise your ``Menu``
won't be responsive.

.. note:: This also allows you to make a "Refresh" entry in your menu - just
          generate contents using ``contents_hook`` (even if they're static) and
          add a ``["Refresh"]`` entry, which won't have a callback but will trigger
          a refresh nevertheless.

Draw on the screen
==================

.. _howto_show_image:

Display an image
----------------

You can easily draw an image on the screen with ZPUI. The easiest way is
by using the ``display_image`` method of ``OutputProxy`` object:

.. code-block:: python

    o.display_image(image) #A PIL.Image object

.. _howto_show_image_better:

However, you might want a user-friendly wrapper around it that would allow
you to easily load images by filename, invert, add a delay/exit-on-key etc.
In this case, you'll want to use the ``GraphicsPrinter`` UI element, which
accepts either a path to an image you want to display, or a ``PIL.Image``
instance and supports some additional arguments:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import GraphicsPrinter
    ...
    # Will display the ZPUI splash image for 1 second
    # By default, it's inverted
    GraphicsPrinter("splash.png", i, o, 1)
    # Same, but the image is not inverted
    GraphicsPrinter("splash.png", i, o, 1, invert=False)
    # Display an image from the app folder - using the local_path helper
    GraphicsPrinter(local_path("image.png"), i, o, 1)
    # Display an image you drew on a Canvas
    GraphicsPrinter(c.get_image(), i, o, 1)

In case you have a Canvas object and you just want to display it, there's
a shorthand:

.. code-block:: python

    c.display()

------------

.. _howto_using_canvas:

Draw things on the screen - basics
----------------------------------

Uou can use the Canvas objects to draw on the screen.

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import Canvas
    ...
    c = Canvas(o) # Create a canvas
    c.point((1, 2)) # Draw a point at x=1, y=2
    c.point( ( (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4) ) ) # Draw some more points
    ... # Draw other stuff here
    c.display() # Display the canvas on the screen

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_1.png

------------

Draw text
---------

You can draw text on the screen, and you can use different fonts. By default, a 8pt font
is used:

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    c.text("Hello world", (0, 0)) # Draws "Hello world", starting from the top left corner
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_2.png

You can also use a non-default font - for example, the Fixedsys62 font in
the ZPUI font storage:

.. code-block:: python

    c.text("Hello world", (0, 0), font=("Fixedsys62.ttf", 16)) # Same, but in a 16pt Fixedsys62 font
    c.text("Hello world", (0, 0), font=(local_path("my_font.ttf"), 16) ) # Using a custom font from your app directory

------------

Draw centered text
------------------

You can draw centered text, too!

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    c.centered_text("Hello world") # Draws "Hello world" in the center of the screen
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_7.png

You can also draw text that's centered on one of the dimensions:

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    ctc = c.get_centered_text_bounds("a") # Centered Text Coords
    # ctc == Rect(left=61, top=27, right=67, bottom=37)
    c.text("a", (ctc.left, 0)) 
    c.text("b", (str(ctc.left-ctc.right), ctc.top)) # ('-6', 27)
    c.text("c", (ctc.left, str(ctc.top-ctc.bottom))) # (61, '-10')
    c.text("d", (0, ctc.top))
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_8.png

------------

Draw a line
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    c.line((10, 4, "-8", "-4")) # Draws a line from top left to bottom right corner
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_3.png

------------

Draw a rectangle
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    c.rectangle((10, 4, 20, "-10")) # Draws a rectangle in the left of the screen
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_4.png

------------

Draw a circle
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    c.circle(("-8", 8, 4)) # Draws a circle in the top left corner - with radius 4
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_5.png

.. note:: There's also a ``Canvas.ellipse()`` method, which takes four coordinates
          instead of two + radius.

------------

Invert a region of the screen
-----------------------------

If you want to highlight a region of the screen, you might want to invert it:

.. code-block:: python

    c = Canvas(o)
    c.text("Hello world", (5, 5))
    c.invert_rect((35, 5, 80, 17)) # Inverts, roughly, the right half of the text
    c.display()

.. image:: _static/canvas_test_6.png

.. note:: To invert the whole screen, you can use the ``invert`` method.

------------

.. _howto_improve_support:

Make your app easier to support
===============================

.. _howto_add_logging:

Add logging to your app
-----------------------

In case your application does something more complicated than printing a sentence
on the display and exiting, you might need to add logging - so that users can then
look through the ZPUI history, figure out what was it that went wrong, and maybe
submit a bugreport to you!

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import setup_logger # Importing the needed function
    logger = setup_logger(__name__, "warning") # Getting a logger for your app, 
    # default level is "warning" - this level controls logging statements that
    # will be displayed (and saved in the logfile) by default.
    
    ...
    
    try:
        command = "my_awesome_script"
        logger.info("Calling the '{}' command".format(command))
        output = call(command)
        logger.debug("Finished executing the command")
        for value in output.split():
            if value not in expected_values:
                logger.warning("Unexpected value {} found when parsing command output; proceeding".format(value))
    except:
        logger.exception("Exception while calling the command!")
        # .exception will also log the details of the exception after your message

Add names to your UI elements
-----------------------------

UI elements aren't perfect - sometimes, they themselves cause exceptions. In this case,
we'll want to be able to debug them, to make sure we understand what was it that went
wrong. Due to the nature of ZPUI and how multiple apps run in parallel, we need to be
able to distinguish logs from different UI elements - so, each UI element has a ``name``
attribute, and it's included in log messages for each UI element. By default, the
attribute is set to something non-descriptive - we highly suggest you set it
to tell:

* which app the UI element belongs to
* which part of the app the UI element is created

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import Menu
    ...
    Menu(contents, i, o, name="Main menu of Frobulator app").activate()

.. note:: The only UI elements that don't support the ``name`` attribute are Printers:
          ``Printer``, ``GraphicsPrinter`` and ``PrettyPrinter``

Use failsafe item fetching
--------------------------

When working with dictionaries, it's tempting to write straightforward
code that uses straightforward item fetching, like ``my_dict["key1"]``.
However, in certain cases this might fail - the most obvious one is, what if the dictionary
is outside of your control and you end up with a dict that doesn't have the "key1" key?
It will throw ``KeyError``, of course, stopping your code from reaching the goal.
Here's how to fetch items from untrusted dictionaries:

.. code-block:: python

     value = my_dict.get("key1", "default_value")

Of course, it's not needed everywhere, but it does make sense to do it when, say,
working with user input, data generated by other software out of your control,
and even config files (they're there to be changed, which means they will be broken
at some point). To sum up, this is a great trick for foolproofing your app.

Config (and other) files
========================

Read JSON from a config file located in the app directory
---------------------------------------------------------

You'll want to configure your application from time to time - typically,
to allow users to change your app's configuration, but it's also useful for storing
user-specific data, allow other software to change your app's configuration, or
simply a way to hide all those magic numbers in your code out of plain sight.

JSON dictionaries are a good fit in that they convert to Python objects pretty easily
- you can store strings, numbers, dictionaries and lists. A suggested config file for
an app would be a dictionary (an "object" in JSON terms), here's an example of how
that could look like for a music player app, one to needs to store a few settings that
were set by the user:

.. code-block:: json

    {
     "shuffle":true,
     "repeat":true,
     "last_directory":"/home/pi/music",
     "disabled_plugins":["lyrics", "thumbnails"]
    }

Here's the simplest way to read data from a config file located in an app's directory:

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import read_config, local_path_gen
    config_filename = "config.json"
    
    local_path = local_path_gen(__name__)
    config = read_config(local_path(config_filename))

Do you have more requirements for your config file = like, easily saving it, restoring
it on failure, as well as some primitive migrations as you update your app? The next
example will probably work for your needs.

------------

.. _howto_config_file:

Read a config file with "restore to defaults on error", migrations and save_config() method
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's, however, a way to work with config files that you're the most likely to use.
It allows you to read an app-specific config, restore it to defaults if the reading/parsing
fails for some reason and get a convenient ``save_config()`` method to save it.

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import read_or_create_config, local_path_gen, save_config_gen
    default_config = '{"your":"default", "config":"to_use"}' #has to be a string
    config_filename = "config.json"
    
    local_path = local_path_gen(__name__)
    config = read_or_create_config(local_path(config_filename), default_config, menu_name+" app")
    save_config = save_config_gen(local_path(config_filename))

To save the config, use ``save_config(config)`` from anywhere in your app.

.. note:: The faulty ``config.json`` file will be copied into a ``config.json.faulty`` 
          file before being overwritten

.. warning:: If you're reassigning contents of the ``config`` variable from inside a
             function, you will likely want to use Python ``global`` keyword in order
             to make sure your reassignment will actually work.

In addition
to that, if the highest level of your config is a dictionary, it allows you to perform small
migrations - specifically, auto-adding new keys with default values to the config as your
app is updated to rely on those. 

Say, here's a config you have, created from the default config and then changed
by the user:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "your":"non-default",
      "config":"to_use"
    }

And here's a new default config, with additional ``"but_now"`` key that you roll out through
an app upgrade:

.. code-block:: python

    default_config = '{"your":"default", "config":"to_use", "but_now":"its_updated"}'

The resulting config received from ``read_or_create_config`` will look like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "your":"non-default",
      "config":"to_use",
      "but_now":"its_updated"
    }

------------

"Read", "save" and "restore" - in a class-based app
---------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import read_or_create_config, local_path_gen, save_config_method_gen
    local_path = local_path_gen(__name__)

    class YourApp(ZeroApp):

        menu_name = "My greatest app"
        default_config = '{"your":"default", "config":"to_use"}' #has to be a string
        config_filename = "config.json"
        
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            ZeroApp.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
            self.config = read_or_create_config(local_path(self.config_filename), self.default_config, self.menu_name+" app")
            self.save_config = save_config_method_gen(self, local_path(self.config_filename))

To save the config, use ``self.save_config()`` from anywhere in your app class.

------------

.. _howto_local_path:

Get path to a file in the app directory
---------------------------------------

Say, you have a ``my_song.mp3`` file shipped with your app. However, in order to use
that file from your code, you have to refer to that file using a path relative to the
ZPUI root directory, such as ``apps/personal/my_app/my_song.mp3``.

Here's how to get that path automatically, without hardcoding which folder your app is put in:

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import local_path_gen
    local_path = local_path_gen(__name__)
    mp3_file_path = local_path("my_song.mp3")

In case of your app having nested folders, you can also give multiple arguments to
``local_path()``:

.. code-block:: python

    song_folder = "songs/"
    mp3_file_path = local_path(song_folder, "my_song.mp3")

------------

.. _howto_run_tasks_for_app:

Run tasks on app startup
=====================================

How to do things on app startup in a class-based app?
-----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ZeroApp.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)
        # do your thing
     
------------

Run a short task only once when your app is called
--------------------------------------------------

This is suitable for short tasks that you only call once, and that won't conflict
with other apps.

.. code-block:: python

    def init_app(input, output):
        # if we define our own init_app, we need to do this
        global i, o
        i = input; o = output
        init_hardware() #Your task - short enough to run while app is being loaded

.. warning:: If there's a chance that the task will take a long time, use one
             of the following methods instead.

------------

Run a task only once, first time when the app is called
-------------------------------------------------------

This is suitable for tasks that you can only call once, and you'd only need to
call once the user activates the app (maybe grabbing some resource that could
conflict with other apps, such as setting up GPIO or other interfaces).

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import Oneshot
    ...
    def init_hardware():
        #can only be run once

    #since oneshot is only defined once, init_hardware function will only be run once,
    #unless oneshot is reset.
    oneshot = Oneshot(init_hardware)
    
    def callback():
        oneshot.run() #something that you can't or don't want to init in init_app
        ... #do whatever you want to do

Run a task in background after the app was loaded
-------------------------------------------------

This is suitable for tasks that take a long time. You wouldn't want to execute that task
directly in ``init_app()``, since it'd stall loading of all ZPUI apps, not allowing the user
to use ZPUI until your app has finished loading (which is pretty inconvenient for the user).

.. code-block:: python

    from helpers import BackgroundRunner
    ...
    def init_hardware():
        #takes a long time

    init = BackgroundRunner(init_hardware)
    
    def init_app(i, o):
        ...
        init.run() #something too long that just has to run in the background,
        #so that app is loaded quickly, but still can be initialized.

    def callback():
        if init.running: #still hasn't finished
            PrettyPrinter("Still initializing...", i, o)
            return
        elif init.failed: #finished but threw an exception
            PrettyPrinter("Hardware initialization failed!", i, o)
            return
        ... #everything initialized, can proceed safely

Context management
==================

Contexts are the core concept of ZPUI multitasking. They allow you to switch between apps
dynamically, use notifications, global hotkeys etc. One common usage of contexts would be
creating menus that appear on a button press.

Get the context object
----------------------

In order to interact with your app's context object, you first need to get it. If your
app is a simple one (function-based), you need to add a ``set_context()`` method that
needs to accept a context object as its first argument. This function will be called
after ``init_app`` is called. In case of a class-based app, you need to have a
``set_context()`` method in the app's class. Once you get the context object, you
can do whatever you want with it and, optionally, save it internally. Here's an example
for the function-based apps:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_context(received_context):
        global context
        context = received_context
        # Do things with the context

Here's an example for the class-based apps:

.. code-block:: python

    def set_context(self, received_context):
        self.context = received_context
        # Do things with the context

Check and request focus for your app
------------------------------------

User can switch from your app at any time, leaving it in the background. You won't receive
any key input in the meantime - the screen interactions will work as intended regardless 
of whether your app is the one active, but the actual screen won't be updated with your 
images until the user switches back to your app. Here's how to check whether your app
is the one active, and request the context manager to switch to your app:

.. code-block:: python

    if not context.is_active():
        has_switched = context.request.switch()
        if has_switched:
            ... # Request to switch has been granted, your app is now the one active

.. warning:: Don't overuse this capability - only use it when it's absolutely necessary, otherwise
             the user will be annoyed. Also, keep in mind that your request might be denied.

Set a global key callback for your app
--------------------------------------

You can define a hotkey for your app to request focus - or do something else. This way,
you can have a function from your app be called when a certain key is pressed from any
place in the interface.

.. code-block:: python

    # Call a function from your app without switching to it
    context.request_global_keymap({"KEY_F6":function_you_want_to_call})
    # Request switch to your app
    context.request_global_keymap({"KEY_F6":self.context.request_switch})

The ``request_global_keymap`` call returns a dictionary with a keyname as a key for each
requested callback, with ``True`` as the value if the key was set or, if an exception was
raised while setting the , an exception object.

Readability
===========

When writing a ZPUI app, keep in mind that other people might refer to it afterwards,
trying to understand how it works (possibly, also debugging).

How to arrange imports
----------------------

One step towards readability is rearranging your import statements. Here's something you might
start with:

.. code-block:: python

    from ui import GraphicsPrinter # ZPUI libraries
    import json # built-in library
    import smbus # external library, needs to be installed
    ...

ZPUI-proposed way to arrange imports is:

* Built-in libraries
* ZPUI libraries
* External libraries (that you need to install from pip/apt)
* Local imports (something in the same folder as your ``main.py``

It's best if you separate these groups with a single empty line. This is especially
helpful once your app grows big. Here's an example of the end result:

.. code-block:: python

    import json # built-in

    from ui import GraphicsPrinter # ZPUI

    import smbus # external

    import smbus_funcs # local
    ...

.. _howto_things_not_to_do:

Frequent mistakes
=================

Using variables named ``i`` in a function-based app
---------------------------------------------------

If you decided to go the easy way and make a function-based app, do keep in mind
that they require global variables named ``i`` and ``o``. Therefore, if you use
constructs like this in a function:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: warning

    for i in range(8):
        print(i) # do stuff

the local ``i`` will overwrite the global ``i`` variable **locally**. So, this code:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: hint

    for i in range(8):
        print(i)
    Printer("Done!", i, o) # this will fail

will fail. Solutions? Don't use ``i`` as a local name in the same function where you'll
need to access the global ``i``. Also, class-based apps won't suffer from this (admittedly
minor) flaw.

Dynamically building lists/dictionaries with lambdas
----------------------------------------------------

If you're dynamically building contents of a menu/listbox/whatever (for example, using
a ``for`` loop or a list/dictionary comprehension), you will likely need to use lambdas,
like this:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: warning

    interfaces = ["eth0", "wlan0", "lo0"]
    # No! Bad!
    menu_contents = [[if_name, lambda: show_ip(if_name)] for if_name in interfaces]
    Menu(menu_contents, i, o).activate()

However, the lambdas constructed will not refer to the ``if_name`` by value - instead,
it's referred by its name and the value will only be resolved at runtime when the
lambda is called. So, all the ``show_ip`` lambdas constructed will execute with
``"lo0"`` as their first argument (the last value that the ``if_name`` variable
was assigned). There's a workaround - you can create a temporary keyword argument
for the lambda with the default value of ``if_name``:

.. code-block:: python
    :class: hint

    interfaces = ["eth0", "wlan0", "lo0"]
    # The right way
    menu_contents = [[if_name, lambda x=if_name: show_ip(x)] for if_name in interfaces]
    Menu(menu_contents, i, o).activate()

This way, a temporary variable is created, and the ``if_name`` variable is copied into
it by value at list generation time, so the resulting lambda will use the proper value
as the positional argument.
